# from the interation

# Note, that the force sensing of Sawyer is not 100% accurate, and forces around 5N cannot be
# accurately measured. Besids, the TCP forces may have an offset about 5N. Thus, if you want the TCP
# to only move in z-direction it is best, to set set_interaction_control_mode to impedance in all
# other directions, otherwise undesired drifts can occur. Alternatively, working only with impedance
# and different stiffness in different direction is also possible, and I suggest experimenting with
# it.
